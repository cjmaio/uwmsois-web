          My name is <strong>Christopher Maio</strong> and I am a student returning to the <strong>University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee</strong> in order to finish my degree since I was poached up by Uber ATG back in 2016. I am a Senior Staff Software Engineer at Aurora Innovation, a company working to bring self-driving tractor trailer (semi trucks) to the road across the United States.

          <h3>GuestPass</h3>
          <p>While a full time staff member at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Student Affairs IT department, myself along with several students worked to develop a new version of the GuestPass software used by University Housing to manage access control for all of the dorms on campus. This involved a new, web-based portal with the capability to pre-register guests beforehand. This was able to help reduce the friction when students wanted to bring guests into the dorms, as well as friction when provisioning the application for new computers (as it was web based, and did not require a thick client install.</p>
