    Note to the professor:

    The instructions for this assignment say:

      > Note that the text box and function name are already included for you in the HTML file

    However, that does not appear to be the case. I have created the text box, button, and function
    on my own. If I need to do something else, or I downloaded the wrong file, please let me know.
