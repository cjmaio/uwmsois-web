    <h2>Description of Cats</h2>

        <h3><a name="dsh">Domestic Short Hair Cat</a></h3>
        <p>The Domestic shorthair comes in a wide array of colors, sizes, and statures, though they tend to be medium-sized and muscular. They have short, sleek coats and round heads and paws. Because of their mixed parentage, Domestic Shorthairs don't tend to be at-risk for any unusual health complications.</p>
        <p>Animal Planet affectionately refers to Domestic shorthair cats as the mutts of the cat world because they're a mix of various breeds, resulting in a vast range of markings, colors, and personalities. With endless color and pattern combinations, they are a rainbow of cat cuddles.</p>
        <p>Generally speaking, she falls into the medium category for height and weight, and much like her purebred, pedigreed relative, the American shorthair, the Domestic shorthair cat has a muscular build with a round face and eyes. Because she is of mixed ancestry, a Domestic may also be smaller or larger in stature, depending on her genetic makeup.</p>
        <p>The World Cat Federation (WCF) notes that Domestics should have a balanced, solid body structure, with a head, nose, and ears that are proportionate to her body. But, as a trip to your local shelter will confirm, household cats come in many shapes and sizes.</p>

        <h3><a name="siamese">Siamese</a></h3>
        <p>The Siamese is built on long athletic lines, standing tall on slender legs with neat oval paws. Ears are large, pricked and give an intelligent expression, following the lines of the triangular shaped head. Eyes are almond shape and slant inwards towards the nose, and the tail is long, tapering, and straight. The coat is short and fine, lying close against the body and the Siamese colours are pale, with darker shaded "points", i.e., the face, ears, legs and tail.</p>
        <p>In terms of appearance, there are two Siamese cat types, the traditional one who is plumper and has an apple-shaped head and the modern one who is very slender and whose head is more wedge-shaped.</p>

        <h3><a name="russian">Russian Blue</a></h3>
        <p>The Russian blue is a sweet-tempered, loyal cat who will follow her owner everywhere, so don't be surprised if she greets you at the front door! While she has a tendency to attach to one pet parent in particular, she demonstrates affection with her whole family and demands it in return. It's said that Russian blues train their owners rather than the owners training them, a legend that's been proven true time and again.</p>
        <p>They are very social creatures but also enjoy alone time and will actively seek a quiet, private nook in which to sleep. They don't mind too much if you're away at work all day, but they do require a lot of playtime when you are home. Russian blues tend to shy away from visitors and may hide during large gatherings.</p>

        <h3><a name="maine-coon">Maine Coon</a></h3>
        <p>The Maine coon is the largest domestic cat breed, and largeness is certainly one of its defining physical characteristics. The size of a typical Maine coon comes in at 10–16 inches tall and up to an impressive 40 inches in length. These sturdily built felines usually weigh 8–18 pounds and have muscular bodies with wide chests and solid legs.</p>
        <p>As if their big-boned build wasn't enough, the ample fur in the Main coone's coat makes these majestic animals look even bigger. Their long coat is silky and smooth and grows shorter near the shoulders. Maine coons come in a variety of colors and patterns. You can find solid white, cream, red, blue, and black Maine coons, as well as tabby, bi-color, particolor, tortoiseshell, shaded, and calico Maine coons.</p>
        <p>Other defining physical features are large pointed ears often topped with wisps of hair, expressive oval-shaped eyes, and a long, bushy tail.</p>
