# Assessment 8 - Final Project

Create a software application based on a real world problem of your choosing. Create original program using code in class and submit content + working and testing code.

EACH RESPONSE SHOULD BE SEPARATE FILES - MULTIPLE, SEPARATE FILES.

## Introduction to Credit Tracker

The name of my project is Credit Tracker.

Right now personally, I track all of my lines of credit and various statistics about them in a spreadsheet. This works fine, but it would be nice to automate it. I've tried to use several solutions like Rocket Money, Tiller, YNAB, etc... but they're always far too heavyweight when I just want to have an "at a glance" view of my debts. To get the exact kind of tracking that I want, it would be ideal to write my own bit of software to track this information. (might need to add more here about describing opportunity or problem?)

## Goals

Goals of this project are to provide tracking for lines of credit (credit cards or regular revolving lines of credit). I will want to be able to track things like card network, company, card type, date opened, last updated date, annual fees, interest rates, credit limits, current balances, etc. I will also want to be able to query things like... cards with the highest interest, highest balance, highest utilization, etc.

## Scope

End result of the project will be a command line utility that will allow me to add, update, and delete accounts. It will also allow me to get summary data back (see above).

Specifically out of scope would be any types of credit outside of revolving credit (e.g. loans) or tracking of income.

## Program Design

TODO Describe your program's inputs, outputs, and associated processes. You can text and formula, or may also use a flowchart, structured english, or any other standardized visual methods.

- Line of Credit (CC or LoC)
    - Card Network
    - Company
    - Card Type
    - Date Opened
    - Annual Fee
    - Interest Rate (variable vs non, prime rate (external) + some amount)
    - Credit limit
    - Current balance
    - Last updated at

## Documentation

TODO Document how your program behaves to the user
